**Study Title:** COVID-19: Psychological Flexibility & Mental Health in the UK
**Study Description:** The current COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the daily lives of most of the population of the UK in ways that would have been largely unimaginable just weeks ago. This research hopes to look at the different ways people are managing these changes and how these individual differences may relate to a person’s general mental health and sense of wellbeing. The results of this study will be used to inform future interventions and therapeutic approaches for helping people to cope with adverse situations that are out of their control. **Open to those living in the UK and aged 18+**

**Study Title:** Coronavirus and Autism Behavioral Study (CABS)
**Study Description:** Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be potentially vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We are conducting a national study on the impact of the coronavirus on children with autism spectrum disorder and their families, with a particular interest in demographics and diversity. Broadly, we want to track the development of children with autism throughout the quarantine period of the pandemic, and learn about the emotional wellbeing and structure of the family during this time. Results from this study are hoped to help clinicians and practitioners improve treatments and services over time, supporting educational, behavioral, and social health in both children with autism and their families. Having a greater understanding of the development of children with autism following a pandemic should benefit care and enhance success in meeting the needs of these patients and their surrounding community.
**This study might be a good fit if you:**
• are over the age of 18-years-old;
• have a child with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) between the ages of 3- and 10-years-old;
• are comfortable reading and answering questions about you and your child in English, and have access to an electronic device;
• currently live in the United States.

**Study Title:** COVID-Cog: Cognitive Outcomes after COVID-19 Infection
**Study Description:** There is an urgent need to understand the neurocognitive impact of COVID-19. As there are millions of people globally surviving COVID-19 there are key questions remain: does COVID-19 infection result in significant cognitive impairment? Is the burden of cognitive impairment greater in those who require ICU stay vs. those hospitalized outside the ICU vs. those in the community?  And are there interactions with sex, age and medical risk factors that result in greater impact in some populations? To answer these questions, we need thousands of people from around the world, who have tested positive at some point for COVID-19, to participate in our study. The study itself consists of a survey that asks questions about COVID history, demographics, lifestyle, and general health, followed by a series of online games that measure different aspects of cognitive functioning; altogether, this takes less than 1 hour. We will also invite participants to complete the study again after 3 and 12 months, to examine how COVID-related impacts on cognition and general health change over time. **Individuals who have had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19, are over 18 years of age, and are fluent in English, French, or Spanish are invited to participate.**

**Study Title:** A CBT-based Mobile Intervention as First Line Treatment for Adolescent Depression During COVID-19
**Study Description:** Over 3 million teenagers in the USA have depression, and rates of depression and suicide are sharply increasing. Teenage depression has far-reaching consequences including impairments in academic and work performance and social and family relationships, substance abuse, and worsening of other health conditions, which can persist into adulthood. Access to mental health care for teenagers is limited due to a shortage of mental health providers and many teenagers and parents are reluctant to take antidepressants. COVID-19 and mandated physical and social distancing is expected to increase rates of teenage depression, and further limit access to traditional methods of care (e.g. psychotherapy). This highlights an urgent need to develop accessible, digital treatments for teenage depression to address the serious mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study will compare the relative safety, effectiveness, and engagement of a mobile application based on cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation (Limbix Spark), focusing on the idea that engaging in behaviors that are rewarding or provide a sense of mastery can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression.
