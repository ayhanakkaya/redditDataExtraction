It is critical to understand the primary problems, concerns, and needs—as well as how these vary by demographic and social characteristics and across time—among youths and families affected by COVID-19, from their own perspectives. We aim to collect these data, with the ultimate goal of informing which mental health interventions and tools, focused on which problems, might be most beneficial for families as the COVID-19 crisis progresses, and if similar situations arise in the future, as many professionals are predicting. **Open to those between the ages of 10-26 years old AND/OR those that are a caregiver to someone who is between the ages of 0-26 years old who is currently living with you**\n",
